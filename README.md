### Features

1. **Strong Encryption End-to-end encryption:** Passwords should be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Only you should have access to decrypt your data (typically via your master password). AES-256 encryption: The best password managers use AES-256 bit encryption to ensure strong security.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enhanced login security:** Supports 2FA to add an extra layer of protection to your master account.
3. **Password Generation Strong password generator: The ability to generate random, complex passwords that are difficult to guess. Customization options: Customize length, character types (letters, numbers, symbols), and other parameters for password strength.
4. **Password Storage Secure storage for all passwords:** Store passwords, login credentials, and other sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, notes).
5. **Password Sharing Secure sharing:** Allow safe sharing of passwords with trusted people (e.g., family members, team members) without revealing the password in plaintext. Control over shared access: You can control who has access and can revoke it at any time.
6. **Secure Notes Storage Storage for sensitive data:** In addition to passwords, you should be able to securely store other sensitive information like credit card details, bank accounts, and personal notes. Encryption for all stored data: All types of sensitive data should be encrypted within the password manager.
7. **Security Features Zero-knowledge architecture:** The service should not be able to access your vault or know your master password. Session timeout and auto-lock: Automatic locking after a period of inactivity for added security.
8. **Privacy and Transparency Privacy policy:** Transparent data collection practices, with no tracking or selling of user data. Auditability: Open-source or independent security audits to prove the serviceâ€™s commitment to privacy.
